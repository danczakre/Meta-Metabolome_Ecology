Readme for Beta Diveristy Null Models folder

The files contained within this folder are the results from the two beta diversity-based
null models that we performed (bNTI and Raup-Crick). The different abbreviations appended
to the file name describe how the data was collected according to the following pattern:

MCD - Data generated using the molecular characteristics dendrogram 
TD - Data generated using the transformation-based dendrogram 
TWCD - Data generated using the transformation-weighted characteristics dendrogram 
bNTI - beta-nearest taxon index results generated according to a given dendrogram
RCBC - Raup-Crick results generated using the subset of metabolites on a given dendrogram
Active40 - Null models were performed using the subset of metabolites considered to be 
	"active" - i.e., associated with > 40 transformations
Inactive - Null models were performed using the subset of metabolites considered to be 
	"inactive" - i.e., associated with no putative transformations
